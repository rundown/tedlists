========

Tedlists app for deployment on openshift architecture.


This is a basic app that runs on Openshift Architecture, specifically the Python App Cart. If you want to use this as is please remember to put your Google API key in the file wsgi.py.

Additionally you are free to modify this app in any way. It would be interesting to know if you do anything with it.


My own installation is at http://tedlists-gulluman.rhcloud.com
